## Arrays (Memorize Each)
**Motive:** Javascript is a small enough language to easily familiarize and gain proficiency within a couple days. Doing so will speed your dev process up incredibly:

1. Array.prototype.push()
2. Array.prototype.pop()
3. Array.prototype.slice() 
4. Array.prototype.shift()
5. Array.prototype.unshift()
6. Array.prototype.length()

## The language
 * Some call Javascript a functional language, others call it an imperative language, others an object-oriented language. What do these terms mean and which is it? 

* The phrase "functions are first class citizens" is thrown around frequently in JS land. What does this mean?




# Part 3: Supplemental
1. What is ES6? ECMAScript? 

2. What does Node.js do?
	
3. What is the technology that Node.js uses that Google Chrome does as well?
